# Sprint 1: SEO & Chat Agent Optimization

## Goal

- Elevate organic visibility for `auto loan calculator`, `RV loan calculator`, `motorcycle loan calculator`, and `jet ski loan calculator` queries.
- Expose structured content that AI/chat agents can ingest for accurate summaries and featured answers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Updated landing page metadata and copy references the targeted vehicle loan calculator keywords naturally.
- Each vehicle type has a dedicated content section with plain-language explanations and comparison points.
- Structured data (FAQ) published in the HTML head or body validates via common schema checkers.
- Internal documentation captures the workstream along with risk assessment and validation steps.

## Tasks Overview

The authoritative sprint backlog now lives in `sprints/sprint-1.json`. That file tracks task identifiers, status, and notes.

| Ticket | Task                                              | Status   | Notes                                                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s1-t1  | Refresh `<head>` metadata                         | Complete | Highlights the primary calculator keywords and refreshed previews.                        |
| s1-t2  | Add SEO-focused content sections                  | Complete | Vehicle-specific sections cover auto, RV, motorcycle, and jet ski calculators.            |
| s1-t3  | Publish FAQPage JSON-LD                           | Complete | Chat-oriented answers exposed via structured data.                                        |
| s1-t4  | Update supporting styles                          | Complete | Ensures the expanded sections remain accessible and on brand.                             |
| s1-t5  | Document risks, mitigations, and validation steps | Complete | Finalized guidance covering risk scenarios, accountable owners, and validation playbooks. |

## Guidelines

- Shared sprint guardrails are documented in `sprints.json`.
- Cap each sprint at ten tickets; create a new sprint once additional work would exceed the cap.
- Keep tickets small, atomic, and as independent as possible to enable smooth sequencing and ownership.

## Progress Summary

- Updated landing page metadata now highlights auto, RV, motorcycle, and jet ski loan calculator keywords alongside refreshed social previews. (`web/dist/index.html`)
- Vehicle-specific SEO content, chat agent briefing notes, and FAQ entries are live on the landing page to support organic and conversational discovery. (`web/dist/index.html`)
- FAQPage JSON-LD answers and supporting styles for the new sections ship with the build, ensuring structured data validation and consistent presentation. (`web/dist/index.html`, `web/dist/style.css`)
- Risk, mitigation, and validation documentation has been published, giving delivery and operations teams clear owners and follow-up actions to maintain the sprint outcomes. (`docs/sprints/1-seo-chat.md`)

## Chat Agent Enablement

- Provide a concise `data-chat-summary` block that agents can quote verbatim.
- Supply FAQ entries with explicit prompts and responses for auto/RV loan calculations.
- Ensure copy uses consistent terminology (`vehicle loan calculator`, `auto loan calculator`, etc.) to reduce hallucination risk.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                                    | Impact                                         | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-optimization could hurt readability or user trust. | Users may bounce if copy feels spammy.         | Content owner reviews each sprint update for plain-language tone before release; marketing lead spot-checks post-launch metrics for bounce spikes and rolls back copy if needed. |
| Structured data syntax errors.                          | Search engines ignore FAQ data or flag errors. | Build step runs `npm run lint:structured-data`; release manager validates FAQ JSON-LD via schema.dev and Search Console rich-result testing before deploy approval.              |
| Additional sections affect layout on mobile.            | Poor UX on small screens.                      | QA lead validates responsive layouts at 320px, 768px, and 1024px breakpoints; regressions generate follow-up CSS fixes prior to release.                                         |
| Data or rate changes render published answers stale.    | Chat agents serve outdated terms or guidance.  | Product owner schedules quarterly content reviews and coordinates with finance to refresh rate assumptions; publish updates via the standard release checklist.                  |

## Validation

1. Run `make lint` and `pytest` to confirm build health before publishing documentation updates.
1. Execute `make validate-local` to ensure structured data and page metadata still satisfy automated checks after content edits.
1. Re-run the FAQ schema through schema.dev or Googleâ€™s Rich Result test and archive the validation screenshot in the sprint folder.
1. Perform manual responsive checks at the documented breakpoints to confirm no regressions slipped past automation.
