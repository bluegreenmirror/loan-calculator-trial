# Product Plans Documentation

This directory consolidates the product planning material that previously lived in the `docs/next` and `docs/v2-plan-consolidated` folders. Each file name now includes the relevant plan prefix to make it clear which release cycle it belongs to.

- Files that start with `next-` originated from the former `docs/next` directory and describe the forward-looking roadmap.
- Files that start with `v2-` contain the historical v2 consolidated planning documents. The unified PRD now lives in `v2-prd.md` and merges the previous `next` and `v2` perspectives into a single source of truth.

Please update or add new planning material directly in this directory using the same naming convention so everything remains in a single, easy-to-browse location.
