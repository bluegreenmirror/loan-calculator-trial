## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bluegreenmirror/loan-calculator-trial
cd loan-calculator-trial

# Set environment for local dev
cp .env.example .env
# Edit DOMAIN and EMAIL in .env

# Run the stack
./deploy.sh --build

# Open https://$DOMAIN
```

Set `DOMAIN` to your hostname and `EMAIL` to the address used for Let's Encrypt certificates.

## API

Base URL in dev: `http://localhost`

- Health:

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/health
  ```

- Quote (POST JSON):

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/quote -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"vehicle_price":35000,"down_payment":3000,"apr":6.9,"term_months":60,"tax_rate":0.095,"fees":495,"trade_in_value":0}'
  ```

- Leads (POST JSON):

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/leads -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name":"Jane Doe","email":"jane@example.com","phone":"+14155551212","vehicle_type":"rv","price":75000,"affiliate":"partnerX"}'
  ```

````

Leads are stored in `leads.json` inside `PERSIST_DIR` (default `/data`).

- Affiliate tracking (POST JSON):

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/track -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"affiliate":"partnerX"}'
````

## Front‚Äëend

- Modular static assets in `web/dist` (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`)
- Footer links to legal pages (`privacy.html`, `terms.html`)
- The lead form (to be added) will auto-capture `affiliate`/UTM parameters from the page URL and submit them with the lead payload.
- Vehicle type dropdown (Auto, RV, Motorcycle, Jet Ski) updates APR and term presets.

## Environment variables

All settings live in `.env`:

| var           | dev                 | prod                  | note                         |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `DOMAIN`      | `localhost`         | your domain           | Caddy site address           |
| `EMAIL`       | `admin@example.com` | admin@yourdomain      | Let's Encrypt contact        |
| `PERSIST_DIR` | `/data`             | `/data` or custom dir | Persisted lead/track storage |

## CORS configuration

The API exposes configuration for cross‚Äëorigin requests via the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. Set this to a comma‚Äëseparated list of origins that are permitted to access the API (for example,

`ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://example.com,http://localhost:8080"`).

If `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is not provided, cross‚Äëorigin requests will be blocked by default to reduce the risk of malicious sites interacting with the service.

## Deploying

Any Docker‚Äëfriendly host (Render, Railway, Fly.io, ECS, etc.) will work.

Merges to `main` trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `./deploy.sh --build --pull`. Set repository secrets `DOMAIN` and `EMAIL` beforehand.

1. Point DNS to your server.

1. Ensure repository secrets `DOMAIN` and `EMAIL` are configured in GitHub.

1. In `.env`, set:

   ```bash
   ADDR=${DOMAIN}
   TLS_DIRECTIVE=tls ${EMAIL}
   ```

   and remove `AUTO_HTTPS` and `HSTS_LINE`.

1. Run `./deploy.sh --build`.

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify loan calculations and API endpoints.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

## Linting & Formatting

- Tools: `ruff` (Python), `black` (Python), `yamllint` (YAML), `mdformat` (Markdown).

- Local usage:

  ```bash
  # Install tools (one-time)
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt || pip install ruff black yamllint mdformat mdformat-gfm

  # Check everything
  make lint

  # Auto-format Python and Markdown
  make format
  ```

- Build-time check via Docker:

  ```bash
  # Runs all linters at image build; fails on issues
  docker compose build lint
  # or
  make lint-docker
  ```
