# Vehicle Loan Calculator

Jump‚Äëstart your next ride with a fast, responsive vehicle loan payment calculator for autos, RVs, motorcycles, and jet skis ‚Äî complete with lead‚Äëgen and affiliate tracking. Fully containerized, tuned for growth, and ready to deploy. Calculate, compare, and cruise toward your dream vehicle today!

> **Note:** This project is for demo purposes only as of Aug 25, 2025 and may not result in offers or responses.

## Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Instant calculator**: monthly payment, amount financed, total cost, total interest.
- üìä **Cost breakdown chart**: flat pie chart sized between 200‚Äì260px with generous side and canvas padding, highlighting principal vs interest; tooltips float outside each slice and the caret points back at the chart without getting cut off, with the legend beside it.
- üé∞ **Rolling digits**: payment amounts animate with fast, smooth scrolling numbers.
- üöò **Presets**: Auto, RV, Motorcycle, Jet Ski.
- üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Lead capture**: name/email/phone validated and persisted (+ affiliate/UTM captured automatically).
- ü§ù **Affiliate tracking**: records click metadata; passthrough to form.
- üíê **API for dealerships**: compute quotes, accept leads.
- üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Dockerized**: Caddy (TLS), FastAPI, static web.
- ü§ì **Dev/Prod toggles**: via `.env` + Caddyfile placeholders.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bluegreenmirror/loan-calculator-trial
cd loan-calculator-trial

# Set environment for local dev
cp .env.example .env
# Edit DOMAIN and EMAIL in .env

# Run the stack
./deploy.sh --build

# Open https://$DOMAIN
```

Set `DOMAIN` to your hostname and `EMAIL` to the address used for Let's Encrypt certificates.

## API

Base URL in dev: `http://localhost`

- Health:

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/health
  ```

- Quote (POST JSON):

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/quote -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"vehicle_price":35000,"down_payment":3000,"apr":6.9,"term_months":60,"tax_rate":0.095,"fees":495,"trade_in_value":0}'
  ```

- Leads (POST JSON):

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/leads -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name":"Jane Doe","email":"jane@example.com","phone":"+14155551212","vehicle_type":"rv","price":75000,"affiliate":"partnerX"}'
  ```

Leads are stored in `leads.json` and tracking events in `tracks.json`, both inside `PERSIST_DIR` (default `/data`). Lead names must be non-empty and phone numbers (if provided) must include 10‚Äì15 digits with an optional leading `+`. Affiliate identifiers must not be empty. Invalid submissions are rejected and not written to disk.

- Affiliate tracking (POST JSON):

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost/api/track -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"affiliate":"partnerX"}'
  ```

## Front‚Äëend

- Modular static assets in `web/dist` (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`)
- Footer links to legal pages (`privacy.html`, `terms.html`)
- The lead form (to be added) will auto-capture `affiliate`/UTM parameters from the page URL and submit them with the lead payload.
- Vehicle type dropdown (Auto, RV, Motorcycle, Jet Ski) updates APR and term presets.

## Environment variables

All settings live in `.env`:

| var             | dev                 | prod                  | note                         |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `DOMAIN`        | `example.com`       | your domain           | Used by deploy script        |
| `EMAIL`         | `admin@example.com` | admin@yourdomain      | Let's Encrypt contact        |
| `ADDR`          | `:80`               | `${DOMAIN}`           | Caddy site address           |
| `TLS_DIRECTIVE` | _(empty)_           | `tls ${EMAIL}`        | Enables HTTPS in prod        |
| `PERSIST_DIR`   | `/data`             | `/data` or custom dir | Persisted lead/track storage |

## CORS configuration

The API exposes configuration for cross‚Äëorigin requests via the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. Set this to a comma‚Äëseparated list of origins that are permitted to access the API (for example,

`ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://example.com,http://localhost:8080"`).

If `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is not provided, cross‚Äëorigin requests will be blocked by default to reduce the risk of malicious sites interacting with the service.

## Deploying

Any Docker‚Äëfriendly host (Render, Railway, Fly.io, ECS, etc.) will work.

Merges to `main` trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that writes a `.env` from repository secrets, runs `scripts/check-env.sh` to validate required keys, executes `./deploy.sh --build --pull`, and then calls `scripts/health-check.sh` to curl the root site and `/api/health`. Configure secrets `DOMAIN`, `EMAIL`, `APEX_HOST`, and `WWW_HOST` beforehand.

For a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep server guide (Ubuntu/Debian), see `docs/SERVER_SETUP.md`.

Server setup (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
# One‚Äëtime: copy env and set values
cp .env.example .env
sed -i 's/example.com/your-domain.tld/' .env
sed -i 's/admin@example.com/you@your-domain.tld/' .env

# Optional: bootstrap server prerequisites (Docker, Compose, make, Python venv)
./deploy.sh --bootstrap

# Build and deploy (skips linters/tests by default on servers)
./deploy.sh --build --pull

# To include linters/tests on the server, add --verify
./deploy.sh --build --pull --verify
```

Notes:

- `--verify` runs `make verify` which uses a Python virtualenv and dev tools. The script will create `.venv` and install from `requirements-dev.txt` when `--verify` is provided.
- If Docker requires sudo on first run, the script falls back to `sudo docker`. After bootstrapping, log out and log back in (or run `newgrp docker`).

Manual health check after deploy:

```bash
curl -I http://$(grep ^DOMAIN .env | cut -d= -f2)
```

## Testing

Run linting and the test suite locally before building.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
make verify  # or `make test` to run tests only
```

`deploy.sh --build` automatically runs `make verify`.

### External checks

Some tests depend on external services (for example, an already running Caddy on your machine). These are disabled by default and can be enabled explicitly:

```bash
# Run everything, including external checks
pytest --run-external

# Optional: point the Caddy health check at a custom URL
CADDY_HEALTH_URL=http://localhost:8080 pytest --run-external

# Run only fast, hermetic tests (default behavior)
pytest -k 'not external'

## Releases & Rollback

- Tag a release:
  - `make release-tag VERSION=v0.1.0 VERIFY=1 PUSH=1`
    - Creates an annotated git tag (runs linters/tests if `VERIFY=1`) and pushes it if `PUSH=1`.

- Deploy a specific version (on server):
  - `git checkout v0.1.0 && ./deploy.sh -b --verify`

- Roll back to a previous version (scripted):
  - `make rollback REF=v0.1.0 BUILD=1 VERIFY=1 YES=1`
    - Checks out the ref and redeploys via `deploy.sh`.

Notes:
- Ensure `.env` is present on the server with your production values before deploying.
- If you prefer image-based releases, configure your container registry and extend the scripts to build/push images per tag.
```

## Linting & Formatting

- Tools: `ruff` (Python), `black` (Python), `mypy` with the `pydantic.mypy` plugin, `yamllint` (YAML), `mdformat` (Markdown).

- Local usage:

  ```bash
  # Install tools (one-time)
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt || pip install ruff black mypy yamllint mdformat mdformat-gfm pre-commit

  # Install git hooks
  pre-commit install

  # Check everything
  make lint
  pre-commit run --all-files

  # Auto-format Python and Markdown
  make format
  ```

- Build-time check via Docker:

  ```bash
  # Runs all linters at image build; fails on issues
  docker compose build lint
  # or
  make lint-docker
  ```

- Caddyfile validation:

  - `make lint-caddy` validates the `Caddyfile` using the official `caddy:2.8` image. It loads environment variables from `.env` if present, otherwise falls back to `.env.example`. This allows CI to validate without requiring secrets. Ensure `ADDR` and `TLS_DIRECTIVE` are present in one of these files when running locally.

## Continuous Integration

Pull requests trigger GitHub Actions to run linters and build all Docker images.
