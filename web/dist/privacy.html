    <h2>3) Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We do not share your information for targeted advertising.

We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

    <h2>4) Cookies & Tracking</h2>

    <h2>7) Your Rights (U.S. & Canada, small-scale context)</h2>
